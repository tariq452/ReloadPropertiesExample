# Reload Properties Example
To reload properties in Java at runtime, you need to create a mechanism that periodically checks for changes in the properties file and reloads the properties if any changes are detected. One way to do this is to use a `Timer` and a `TimerTask` that runs at a fixed interval and checks the modification timestamp of the properties file. If the timestamp has changed, the properties are reloaded.

Here's an example Java code that demonstrates how to reload properties at runtime:
